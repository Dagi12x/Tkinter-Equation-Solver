# Tkinter-Equation-Solver

## Description

This Python project is a Tkinter-based equation solver with an interactive GUI. It solves linear and quadratic equations, allowing users to input an equation, select the type, and get instant solutions. The solver handles basic operations, displaying roots for quadratic equations and solutions for linear equations.

## Features

- **Linear Equation Solver:** Handles equations of the form `ax + b = c` and provides the solution for `x`.
- **Quadratic Equation Solver:** Handles equations of the form `ax^2 + bx + c = 0` and computes the roots, including cases with no real roots.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive interface with options to input equations and select the equation type.
- **Error Handling:** Displays error messages for invalid input or unsolvable equations.

## Installation

To use this application, you need to have Python installed on your system along with the Tkinter library, which is included with most Python installations.
